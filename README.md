# Object Detection Using YOLOv5

This repository contains a simple and effective implementation of object detection using the YOLOv5 model. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm with high accuracy and speed.

## Features
- Detect objects in images using the pre-trained YOLOv5 model.
- Save results with bounding boxes drawn on the detected objects.
- Easy-to-use code with minimal dependencies.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- ultralytics (YOLOv5 library)
- OpenCV (optional, for image processing)

## Contributing
Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests for improvements.
